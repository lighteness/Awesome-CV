\begin{cvparagraph}

I have 5 years of experience operating Kubernetes clusters and am skilled in best practices and troubleshooting. I understand Kubernetes components such as CSI, CNI, and CRI, and I'm acquainted with common network solutions like Calico, Flannel, and Weave. I've demonstrated my ability to use the Operator pattern, integrating both infrastructure and operational capabilities into Kubernetes. I am familiar with the CNCF ecosystem, and I utilize it to benefit businesses and enhance development processes. My experience extends to microservices, allowing me to set up custom services tailored to enterprise needs. I am well-versed in both common public cloud and on-premises environments and adept at using Terraform to implement infrastructure as code.
